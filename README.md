# Game and Bot: Bevy

I'm remaking my old project, "Game and Bot", which was originally a Unity game exported as a WebGL build to run in the browser. The link is still live on GitHub Pages, so it should remain accessible for a while. I'm proud of the logic behind it, especially the large-scale enemy pathfinding and procedural dungeon level generation, which are aspects I really like.

However, much of the surrounding code has aged poorly, and I believe I can improve it significantly. This time, I'll remake it using Rust and the Bevy game engine. The game is pretty simple, so it doesn't require a complex engine like Unity or Godot. With Bevy, I can also export it as WASM to host it online again. That's the plan moving forward.
